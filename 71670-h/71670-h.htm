delicious dessert, the minute they read about it</em></p>

<p class="no-indent fs120"><em>Now they write</em></p>

<p><em>From Oklahoma</em>—“We served
raspberry for dinner and we were
more than delighted. It is delicious.
Royal Fruit Gelatin has completely
won our hearts.”</p>

<p><em>In Massachusetts they say</em>—“It is
delicious and all that you claim for
it, and I shall certainly use it after
this.”</p>

<p>“Your gelatin is better than any
other brand. The orange gelatin
was especially good and the flavor
exactly like the fresh fruit. If I had
held an orange in one hand and the
opened box of gelatin in the other,
it would have been hard to tell by
smell which was which,” <em>writes an
enthusiast in Pennsylvania</em>.</p>

<p><em>They love it in Ohio!</em>—“I am writing
to express my satisfaction with
the real fruit flavor, and to say it is
the finest thing in the gelatin line I
have ever had. The children are
saying ‘please get some more!’
Where can I buy it?”</p>

<p><em>In New York State</em>—“I found
Royal Gelatin far superior to the
brand I have been using, as it is
tastier and lends itself well to the
adding of fruit,” <em>writes one delighted
woman</em>.</p>

in<br>
Flavors</em></p>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> fresh, fragrant aroma, that
greets you the moment you
open the package—how delicious
it is—how different from any
gelatin you have ever bought before.
You recognize its distinction
with the first whiff—it’s the very
aroma of the sun-ripened fresh fruits
themselves.</p>

<p>Pour a little of it into your hand.
Note the rich heaviness of the delicate
fruit-flavored crystals. Empty
the package into a bowl, and pour
on the boiling water—Ah! Just
smell the rich fragrance!
Like ripe fruit, warm
with sunshine and
drenched with dew.</p>

<p>Taste these new gelatins
carefully—roll them
on your tongue. There
is no strange flavor—no
“manufactured” taste at
all. Not the faintest
trace of “gummy” taste<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
or “gluey” smell.
The pure gelatin that
carries these fresh fruit
flavors does not alter
their delicacy, their aroma, in any
way. For no synthetics or artificial
flavorings are used. And pure, perfect
gelatin of itself is neutral to
taste and smell.</p>
<br>

<p class="center no-indent fs90 bold"><em>Real fruit flavors made from<br>
fresh fruits</em></p>

<p>Royal Raspberry—ripe, luscious,
melting, like the very berries from
whose juice its flavor comes.</p>

<p>Royal Strawberry—hold
it to the light! It’s
the real strawberry
shade—gleaming, perfect.
And its flavor—straight
from the juice
of that most perfect fruit.</p>

<p>Sniff the cherry-ripe
fragrance that rises as
you melt the crystals of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
Royal Cherry—gleaming, dancing
under the leaves, playing hide and
seek with the sunshine ... that’s the
way the juice from which this flavor
is made is ripened and sweetened.</p>

<p>Royal Orange with its golden
beauty—Royal Lemon, clear, translucent,
pure ... with
the delicious flavor and
fragrance only the
fruits themselves can
give—how delectable
they are.</p>

<p class="fs90 bold"><em>And for health....</em></p>

<p>Famous food specialists
everywhere
recommend gelatin as
an integral part of a
balanced diet. As a
source of protein, a principle of
growth, an active aid to digestion, it
has its established place.</p>

<p>It is especially desirable for children—and
how they love it! While
to the housewife, it is a delicious
dessert that may be made in a
minute—yet capable of so many
toothsome changes that “time cannot
stale its infinite variety.” Nor
(blessed thought!) in spite of its
charm to a sweet tooth, is it fattening
at all!</p>

<p>Of course you want the very
purest gelatin in the world! On<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
general principles, and because it’s
so invaluable for children. You
know you can trust Royal Fruit
Flavored Gelatin quality ... because
for years you have used Royal Baking
Powder, and know its superlative
standard. Royal Fruit Flavored Gelatin
is made by the same standards
of quality and purity.</p>

<p>You’ll be delighted
with its delicate texture,
smooth, tender,
firm, and, with its lovely
color, as appetizing
to look at, as to taste.
And then it’s so quick!
Hundreds of delighted
women have written
to tell us that it sets
more quickly than any
other gelatin they have ever used. For
making whipped desserts, they tell
us it is wonderful. “It whips just like
cream” “and so easily and quickly.”</p>

<p>You’ll notice, and enjoy, the difference
too!</p>
<br>

<p class="center no-indent fs90 bold"><em>With confidence....</em></p>

<p>We introduce Royal Fruit Flavored
Gelatin to our Royal Baking Powder
friends with complete confidence,
and especial pride. We are sure that
the same discriminating taste that insists
upon consistent perfection, will
give it the sure and lasting welcome
that Royal Baking Powder has
always received.</p>

<p class="center no-indent bold"><em>The Package, The Utensils and<br>
Just How to Get Perfect Results</em></p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Each</span> package of Royal Fruit Flavored
Gelatin weighs 3¼ ozs. and measures
½ cup or 8 tablespoons.</p>

<p>Each package of 3¼ ozs. calls for
two cups or one pint water or other liquid and
makes over one pint jelly, or sufficient to serve
six persons.</p>

<p>In order to save time and shorten the cooling
process, one cup boiling water is used to
dissolve the gelatin and one cup cold water or
other liquid to cool it, but if preferred, the two
cups boiling water can be added at once.</p>

<p>If you desire to use a portion of a package
at any time, dissolve two level tablespoons
Royal Fruit Flavored Gelatin in ½ cup boiling
water and this amount can be moulded in a
custard cup and is sufficient for one large
serving.</p>

<p>When a portion of a package of Royal Fruit
Flavored Gelatin is left, close tightly as possible
and keep in a dry place until ready to use.</p>
<br>

<p class="center no-indent bold"><em>Utensils for Measuring, Dissolving,<br>
Moulding and Chilling Royal<br>
Fruit Flavored Gelatins</em></p>

<p class="no-indent fs90">
Kettle for boiling water<br>
Bowl for holding the Gelatin<br>
Measuring cup<br>
Spoon for stirring<br>
Mould or bowl or cup for setting the Gelatin<br>
</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">In measuring</span> the liquid it is important
to use the standard measuring cup holding
½ pint or its equivalent, as the consistency of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
the finished Gelatin depends upon the amount
of water or other liquids used.</p>

<p>Stir the mixture well after boiling water is
added so all will be dissolved. Then add cold
water.</p>

<p>For Whipped Desserts the rotary egg beater
is best and saves much time.</p>
<br>

<p class="center no-indent bold"><em>Moulds</em></p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">There</span> are on the market, tin, aluminum
and china moulds in varying shapes and
sizes. If there is no mould at hand, ordinary
bowls, custard cups or even plain cups can
be used very successfully for moulding Royal
Fruit Flavored Gelatins.</p>
<br>

<p class="center no-indent bold"><em>Chilling</em></p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> quickest way to chill Royal Fruit Flavored
Gelatins is in the ice box. To shorten
the stiffening process still further, set mould in
pan filled with cracked ice, rock salt and water.</p>

<p>In cold weather, the mould, covered, can be
placed on outside window sill. Royal Fruit
Flavored Gelatins chilled in this way will stiffen
in a remarkably short time; in some cases in
one-half to three-quarters of an hour.</p>
<br>

<p class="center no-indent bold"><em>Removing Gelatin From Moulds</em></p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Dip</span> mould very quickly into bowl or pan
of hot water. Loosen carefully from sides
of mould with a knife; place plate or serving
dish over top and quickly turn upside down.
The mould can then be lifted carefully without
spoiling the shape or design.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Royal</span> Fruit Flavored Gelatins are complete
in themselves and
really do not require any garnishings.
However,
they are delicious
served with

cream, custard,
marshmallow or
fruit sauces, recipes
for which are
included in this

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Belinda</span> is that
lovely lucky
creature, the
young matron
of to-day,
setting up housekeeping,
not as a daily
task, but as a comradely
affair. Gone are the walls that
used to separate the generations. Belinda is
firm friends with her grandmother, and her
mother is her clever contemporary. Together
they face the world with a friendly affectionate
dignity, a reasonable freedom and a
healthy ease, that banishes boredom,—lengthens
life.</p>

<p>Gone, too, are the cumbrous clumsy methods
of housekeeping—basement kitchens, hods
of coal, oil lamps and 24-hour bread.... Vanished
with the high bicycles and Waspwaists
of the “Gay Nineties.”</p>

<p>But the spirit of home-making, the desire
to build a pleasant place, and welcome those
you love within its walls—remains the same
to-day as it has been forever.</p>

<p>That welcoming hearth-warming spirit of unflustered
hospitality! Beginning with the dolls’
tea-party, and flowering to graceful perfection
in the charming hostess. Belinda knows that
no entertainment can be
a success, unless the
hostess enjoys it
herself.</p>

<p>So with the deft

made possible
by modern

combines
Martha-Service

Mary-Serenity,
in a manner
entirely

Bridges</em></p>

<p class="no-indent">or plays Mahjong,
she arranges her
tea-party to the taste
of her guests. If she is a
maidless mistress, she excels
in those little intimate parties—“just
one or two tables,” where tea is an
interlude rather than an interval.</p>

<p>Bright and early Belinda makes her most
successful cake and a delectable dish of
Turkish delight. Sandwiches filled with some
clever paste and rolls of wafer bread and butter
are trimmed with their attendant sprigs
of parsley, celery, or radish roses. Covered
lightly with an inverted bowl, and set in the
ice-box till the tea hour, they will be crisp,
fresh and dainty at 5 o’clock. The tea table,
gay with Belinda’s most attractive tea cups,
is set by the fireside, or the open window, to
suit the season; and tea can be made in a
minute.</p>


<p class="center no-indent fs120 bold"><em>For a More Formal Occasion</em></p>

<p>Belinda sets her table in the dining room,
with a non-playing friend or two to pour the

attractive with delicious dainties, it has an
allure that is never gainsaid. The menu may
be—</p>

It is her individual occasion!</p>

<p>The luncheon table demands special attention.
The doilies and lunch cloths must
be laundered to especial perfection, the silver
spotless, the glass and china shining. The
decorations of the table should harmonize
with the dining room. There must be a distinction
about it that can face the daylight.</p>

<p>Belinda loves these gelatin desserts, because
they always arrive at her table cool, interesting,
tender, gleaming with color and distinguished

add to their charm.... Doesn’t that sound
like a description of Favorite Friends? Belinda
looks on them as F.F’s ... and loves them
also for their priceless power of satisfying her
taste for sweets, without adding an inch to
her figure. Because—blessed thought—they
are not fattening at all!</p>

<p>Belinda chooses guests that harmonize, with
the same care that she gives to choosing
flowers that blend with the gown she wears.
Decorative touches on the dinner table perhaps
... gay little place cards or favors, a
scented leaf or blossom floating in each finger
bowl, tall glasses on twisted stems that give
a touch of dignity ... candle light ... comfort.</p>

<p>Whether Belinda cooks and serves the dinner
single handed, or has a staff of servants,
she follows the rule of good breeding that
serves only what can be perfectly cooked and
served, without confusion.</p>

<p>The hot things hot—the cold things cold—sounds
an obvious rule. But more meals than
can be counted have been wrecked by neglect
of it.</p>

<p>Belinda has carefully chosen menus for a
little dinner that can be served to perfection
by a single maid, whose mistress helps with
the preparation.</p>

<p>Belinda thinks that gelatin, with its countless

perfect dessert. Delicious, delicate ... an aid

Perfectly prepared, dished, garnished, before
the last minute cookery begins.</p>
<br>

<p class="center no-indent bold"><em>The Children’s Hour</em></p>

<p>Gelatin seems to have been invented by
some Fairy Godmother who studied children’s
tastes and parents’ dietetic duties. And
merged them into the delicate fruity crystals
that bring protein and growth-promoting
elements, to the active little bodies, while
actually helping the digestive process.</p>

<p>How the children love them too, these desserts
that look like jewels ... fairy bubbles
that melt in the mouth ... delectable as the
fresh fruit from which their flavors are made!</p>

<p>They “make a party” of the simplest meal
... whipped or plain, with custard or with
cream. Raspberry, Strawberry, Orange,
Lemon, or Cherry ripe—their very names
carry the fragrance of a sunlit garden.</p>
